# VocalShifter
VocalShifter is an audio editing software that is available at
https://ackiesound.ifdef.jp/

VocalShifter has a free software version (VocalShifter LE) and a paid version (VocalShifter).
The paid version allows up to 64-bit audio input/output, while the free software version is limited to a maximum of 16 bits.

The engine part of VocalShifter is a DLL and is developed using Visual C++.
The editor part is developed using HSP (https://github.com/onitama/OpenHSP).
Please note that if I release the source code of the editor part, it will be in HSP script format.

There are no plans to open source the software at this time.
The only difference between the paid and free versions of VocalShifter is bit depth, 
so making the free version open source means that the paid version will also be open source.
Therefore, I believe that it would be difficult to open source VocalShifter while maintaining the revenue of the paid version.

If you have any good ideas, either technically or through a licensing agreement, we would appreciate your suggestions.
